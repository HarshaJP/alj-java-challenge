# Experience
1. I have 11 years of experience in Java
2. I have around 6 years of experience in spring and spring boot
3. I have good experience with working in back end.

#Implementation
1. Added a new Employee Object to deal with outer layer so DB layer object will be hidden from outer layer.
2. Implemented basic caching mechanism for Get, Put and Delete API calls on service layer.
3. Exception handling is done with handling different exceptions in the exception package.
4. Implemented basic auth for the application with in-memory implementation.
5. Used a separate constants file for the application constants.
6. All the APIs are working fine as expected.
7. Unit test cases are added for controller and service calls with positive and negative test cases.


#Improvements
1. Logging can be handled for debugging purposes to a specific file/directory.
2. Additional exceptions can be handled as per the message classification required by the application.
3. Authentication, Authorizations and caching can be improved with advance implementation.
